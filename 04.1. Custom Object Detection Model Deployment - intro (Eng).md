The core of the hardware accelerator platform is the CAISA acceleration engine. Corerain's CAISA acceleration engine is a custom artificial intelligence data flow architecture desigend to optimize and accelerate deep learning operators. The architecture is highly scalable and versatile for a variety of deep learning algorithms, and can achieve more than 90% theoretical peak performance of hardware. (currently measured up to 98%)



The list of operators that CAISA can now support is as follows:

| Operator            | Note                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| AvgPool             |                      |
| Conv2D              |                      |
| Conv2DBackpropInput | Deconvolution        |
| Concat              |                      |
| FullyConnected      |                      |

## 2. Introduction to RainBuilder

Corerain's compile tool chain, RainBuilder, is a software development and deployment tool system developed for the CAISA acceleration engine. Users do not need to understand the CAISA hardware-level operation mechanism and principle while using CAISA acceleration engine, they can focus on algorithm development and optimization, as well as compiling and deploying. Rainbuilder provides an easy-to-use development deployment process for users, especially algorithm engineers and software engineers.



Rainbuilder consists of RbRuntime, RbCompiler and RbDriver. The principle of Rainbuilder is shown below:

The algorithm model developed under the deep learning framework of TensorFlow, Caffe, ONNX, etc., can be fully optimized by the RainBuilder Compiler, and RainBuilder Compiler can extracte the intermediate representation `SG IR` from model. Data quantification, operator fusion, hardware and software allocation, etc. are automatically performed during model compilation.



RainBuilder Runtime is the software runtime of the CAISA acceleration engine. It loads the SG-IR and accelerate the deep learning network with CAISA deceleration engine. This component is open as C/C++ API interface to users for secondary development and deployment 



RainBuilder Driver is the relevant driver module of the underlying CAISA architecture, supporting CAISA hardware architecture driver, hardware module computation scheduling, and hardware model analysis. CAISA driever is transparent for application developers, it can automatically fine-grained performance optimization and scheduling.



So for developers, the specific process of development with RainBuilder is shown below:

### 2.1 RbCompiler Workflow Introduction
Before introducing the use of RbCompiler, we need to be familiar with the following keywords in advance:

* **SG**: Streaming Graph, the data structure used by Compiler, each SG graph consists of a series of SGNodes.
* **SG IR**: SR IR is the intermediate representation we use in RbCompiler, and the SR-IR is in `protobuf` format and is composed of a model structure file (.pbtxt) and a model data file (.bin) .
* **SGNode**: SGNode describes a series of calculations in the model. For example, a convolution calculation can represent an SGNode.



RbCompiler's workflow is shown below:

**`Front-End`**：Model analysis, front-end can support deep learning algorithm development frameworks such as TensorFlow, Caffe, and ONNX.

**`Generate SG`**：Convert the model to SG-IR

**`Quantize SG`**：Quantize the SG IR to 8bit

**`Optimize SG`**：According to the computing resource configuration of the FPGA accelerator card, impletement  the operator fusion and the hardware allocation for the SG node.





### 2.2 Operator correspondence of RbCompiler 

The front-end of RbCompiler parses the model at the operator level and converts it into SG-IR that RbRuntime can recognize.

### 2.3 RbRuntime Workflow Introduction

As the backend of RainBuilder, RbRuntime works with RbCompiler to load and run the model file `.pbtxt` and parameters generated by RbCompiler. RbRuntime generates the corresponding model map SG, which contains all the nodes described in the pbtxt file. And Rbruntime creates the corresponding OP according to the node， loads model parameters and input data, schedulse computing nodes, and deploy nodes in the topological order on the corresponding device to perform calculations, and return the calculation results of the model.



The main modules of RbRuntime are:
