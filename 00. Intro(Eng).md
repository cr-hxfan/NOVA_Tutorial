### 2.1 Linux Users

#### 2.1.1 Installation of Corerain docker image

Please confirm that docker-ce is installed on the host. The installation guide of docker-ce is as follows:

Ubuntu：https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

CentOS：https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/



There are two ways to load a Corerain docker image:

1. Load with the image in corerain-public-toold

   ```
   sudo docker load < cr-docker-cpu.tar
   ```

   After loading successfully, it will print as follows

   ```
   Loaded image: corerain/cr-working-env:cpu
   ```



2. Load the image from docker hub

   ```
   sudo docker pull corerain/cr-working-env:cpu
   ```

   the host will download the image from the docker hub and load it.

   ```
   cpu: Pulling from corerain/cr-working-env
   ...
   Status: Downloaded newer image for corerain/cr-working-env:cpu
   ```



Create a docker container after loading the docker image.

>  Note：Please create and specify a local path (such as using <cr root path>)  for container and host for file sharing.

```
mkdir -p /home/<user name>/cr-workspace
sudo docker run --name <pick a name> \
 -v <cr root path>:/cr-workspace \
 --network host \
 --privileged=true \
 -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
 -it corerain/cr-working-env:cpu /bin/bash
```



Then, the terminal has entered the docker container, and the /cr-workspace in the container is the <cr root path> of the host. The cr-workspace path structure is as follows:

```
cr-workspace
└── R2500002201907
 ├── caisa.rbf
 ├── pcie-driver.tar
├── rainbuilder-pkg-cpu.tar
 ├── rainbuilder-pkg-gpu.tar
 ├── chip-id.tar
 └── corerain-use-cases.tar

```



#### 2.1.2 Installation of Rainbuilder

In the docker container, enter the corresponding path to decompress rainbuilder-pkg-cpu.tar. The current example is /cr-workspace/R2500002201907.

```
cd /cr-workspace/R2500002201907
tar -xvf rainbuilder-pkg-cpu.tar
```



Go to the RainBuilder installation package folder and execute install.sh.

```
cd rainbuilder-pkg-cpu
source install.sh
```



Now, a docker container with RainBuilder environment has been created.



Docker's mechanism is similar to instantiating a container through a docker image (the contents of cr-docker-cpu.tar) to form a usable system environment. The docker container environment can be reused after it is created. If the user has established a container environment through 2.1.1 and 2.1.2, it can be reused.



The container information can be found by the following instructions:

```
sudo docker container ls -a
```



Print as follows:

```
CONTAINER ID IMAGE 						 COMMAND 	CREATED 		STATUS 	 PORTS 				NAMES
5c93baa86c3c corerain/cr-working-env:cpu "/bin/bash” 12 seconds ago Exited (0) 8 seconds ago cr-env
```



After exiting the container, you can use the following command to re-enter the container.

```
sudo docker start <NAMES or CONTAINER ID>
sudo docker exec -it <NAMES or CONTAINER ID> /bin/bash
```



### 2.2 windows Users

Windows users need to download DockerToolbox, download link is as follows：

http://cloud.corerain.com:8082/share.cgi?ssid=0Wpe7xw



Double click to install after the download is complete. After the installation, there will be two icons called *Docker Quickstart Terminal* and *VirtualBox* on desktop.



#### 2.2.1 Installation of Corerain docker image

After double-clicking to open the *Docker Quickstart Terminal* on the desktop, there would be a following print in the pop-up dialog box, indicating that you have entered the docker environment.

                        ##         .
                  ## ## ##        ==
               ## ## ## ## ##    ===
           /"""""""""""""""""\___/ ===
      ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
           \______ o           __/
             \    \         __/
              \____\_______/
              
    docker is configured to use the default machine with IP 192.168.99.100
    For help getting started, check out the docs at https://docs.docker.com
    
    Start interactive shell



Then, load the image from docker hub

```
sudo docker pull corerain/cr-working-env:cpu
```



the host will download the image from the docker hub and load it. The print will be as follows:

```
cpu: Pulling from corerain/cr-working-env
...
Status: Downloaded newer image for corerain/cr-working-env:cpu
```



After loading the docker image, create and specify a shared folder.

 1. Open virtualbox, find a virtual machine named default, right click to configure it.

    <img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/07/25/5d3955d51e7b194797.png" style="zoom:70%"  />

 2. Add and name the shared folder, the current example is the *workspace* folder in the D drive

    <img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/07/25/5d394b4ac319373321.png" alt="Picture2.png" title="Picture2.png" />



Create docker container

```
docker run --name <pick a name> \
 -v //workspace:/cr-workspace \
 --network host \
 --privileged=true \
 -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
 -it corerain/cr-working-env:cpu /bin/bash
```

> Note：the name of the mounted shared folder needs to be referenced with "//" when creating a docker container.



#### 2.2.2 Installation of Rainbuilder

In the docker container, enter the corresponding path to decompress rainbuilder-pkg-cpu.tar. The current example is /cr-workspace/R2500002201907.

```
cd /cr-workspace/R2500002201907
tar -xvf rainbuilder-pkg-cpu.tar
```



Go to the RainBuilder installation package folder and execute install.sh.

```
cd rainbuilder-pkg-cpu
source install.sh
```



Now, a docker container with RainBuilder environment has been created.



#### 2.2.3 Installation of MobaXterm

MobaXterm is an enhanced Windows terminal tool that provides all the important remote networking tools (such as SSH client tools).



You can download it from：https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html



Once the installation is complete, open MobaXterm and select Session in the menu bar, enter the session setting interface, and select SSH. Fill in the IP address of the server equipped with the Corerain acceleration card in the Remote host, and then enter your own username.
