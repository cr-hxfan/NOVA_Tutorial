# Intro

These are the tutorials prepared by Professor Wayne Luk from Imperial College London to introduce the basics of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) development, and the principles and practices of the CNN deployment on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA).

The experiments will be ran on the remote server.  

## Connection to Server

### Mac and Linux Users

If you are using MacOS or Linux, you can use **Terminal** to SSH into the server.

Open Terminal and use the following command. 

``` ssh user_name@server_ip_address```

> Note：The server IP address will be provided in groups before the experiment.

### Windows Users

If you are a windows users, we recommend you to download the MobaXterm for our labs.



MobaXterm is an enhanced Windows terminal tool that provides all the important remote networking tools (such as SSH client tools).



You can download it from：https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html

Download the MobaXterm Hone Edition v12.0 (Installation edition). Run the installation file (.msi) and follow the instructure in the installtion GUI. 

Once the installation is complete, open MobaXterm and select Session in the menu bar, enter the session setting interface, and select SSH. Fill in the IP address of the server equipped with the Corerain acceleration card in the Remote host, and then enter your own username.
